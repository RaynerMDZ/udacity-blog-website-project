            <p>Aren’t you tired of dealing with files and streams when you need to upload Multipart File??? Because
                <strong>I am exhausted of it</strong> 😡. Let me introduce a solution to this problem. Yaayyy 😃</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I developed this idea because I was searching for a way to change the name of a Multipart File in Java.
            Sadly, there was not much information about the topic. However, I was thinking of a way to solve this
            problem and the idea of creating a util class came up.</p>

        <p>With this class, you can upload, change the name of the file, and as a bonus you can generate a random name
            for the file in your Java application.</p>

        <img src="images/handy-java-multipart-file-uploader-images/1.png" alt="Picture 1">

        <p>This method takes care of calling the other methods in the class to upload the file.
            It takes a directory as a string, a <em>MultipartFile</em>, and a name as a string. Then, this method
            calls another method called <em>fileSaver()</em> that requires the directory, <em>MultipartFile</em>, and the name.
            <em>FileSaver()</em> returns the saved file. Also, This same method calls another method called <em>fileNameChanger()</em>
            <u>(I am not good at naming methods and variables 😆)</u> which requires the <em>MultipartFile</em> and the File
            returned by the method <em>fileSaver()</em>. The method only returns True if the file is renamed. Otherwise,
            it returns False.</p>

        <p>There is a method that is extremely important in this whole process, without it this could not
            be possible whatsoever. That method is called:</p>

        <img src="images/handy-java-multipart-file-uploader-images/4.png" alt="Picture 4">

        <p>As you can see, This method all it does is get the extension file of the <em>MultipartFile</em>.
            You may ask, why is this?. There is a simple answer for that, you need the extension of the
            <em>MultipartFile</em> before you can create a new file. This is because all we are doing here is creating an
            empty File with the same extension as the <em>MultipartFile</em> provided in the method <em>pictureUploader()</em>.</p>

        <p>After you create the empty file with the corresponding extension, you have to pass the data from
            the <em>MultipartFile</em> to the new Empty File.</p>

        <img src="images/handy-java-multipart-file-uploader-images/5.png" alt="Picture 5">

        <p>This does the same thing as the method above, but with the condition that this time it
            uses a regex to perform the action.</p>

        <p>Why would I do that?</p>

        <p>Simply because programming is fun 😆.</p>

        <p>Lastly, there is a method that I called <u>“The bonus method”</u>. This method all it does is generating a
            random string which you can use as the name of the file that you want to upload.</p>
