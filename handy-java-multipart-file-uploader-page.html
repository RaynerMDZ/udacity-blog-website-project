        <p>Arenâ€™t you tired of dealing with files and streams when you need to upload Multipart File??? Because I am extremely tired of it ðŸ˜¡. Let me introduce a solution to this problem. Yaayyy ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
        <p>I developed this idea because I was searching for a way to change the name of a Multipart File in Java. Sadly, there was not much information about the topic. However, I was thinking of a way to solve this problem and the idea of creating a util class came up.</p>
        <p>With this class, you can upload, change the name of the file, and as a bonus you can generate a random name for the file in your Java application.</p>
